QUICK START GUIDE:

    perl-ldap uses the following modules/distributions.

	Convert::BER - required
	libwww-perl  - optional, needed for URL parsing
	Digest::MD5  - optional, needed for SASL CRAM-MD5 auth

    First ensure the above modules/distributions are installed then
    build/test/install Net::LDAP by doing

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    Several modules in the distribution contain documentation. Once installed
    you can use the 'perldoc Net::LDAP' command to obtain the documentation.
    This documentation will contain pointers to the other modules.

Many things from the previous release have been depricated in this release.
These are

  ->ldapbind() is now ->bind()
  
  Error constants now start with LDAP_ instead of ldap, this is for
  consistency with other libraries
  
  ->read_ldif and ->ldif methods on Net::LDAP::Entry objects has been replaced
  by the Net::LDAP::LDIF module

  option names to methods are now passed in all lowercase without the leading -
  
  ->get_attribute in Net::LDAP::Entry has been replaced by ->get

*******************************************************************************
NOTE: Everything that has been depricated will be removed when V1.00 is
released, but who knows when that will be.
