Original Perl 5 Net::LDAP credits

Although the Net::LDAP module was originally written by Graham Barr it
has grown far beyond initial expectations and scope. In fact it has gone
far beyond a lot of things.

As Net::LDAP has grown into the perl-ldap distribution credit can no
longer be given to any single individual, but instead belongs to a
group of people who have contributed. Some more than others, but whos
counting :)

To give due honor to those who have made perl-ldap what is is today, here
are some of the people who have contributed, either in code, documentation
or just ideas/feedback. If I have missed anyone, please let me know.
